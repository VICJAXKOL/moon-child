     <h4><ul>The academic staff union of universities (ASUU) was founded in 1978. Since it's existence, it has embarked on strike 16 times since 1999 till date. Due to the refusal of the government fulfilling their promises of increasing lecturers salaries, increasing funding of public universities and so on.

     <h4><ul>Even after several meeting with the federal government over the years, mostly ending with disagreement between the two parties up till date. The federal government has refused to fulfill their promise to the union even going to the extent of sending fake transfers to the union. This long term disagreement has led to several universities going on strike, leading to the frustrations of the students, which may result in them spending more years than expected in school.

    <h4><ul> With the ASUU strike becoming a norm, students are now reading less because of the lack of hope that it will be called off. This will eventually lead to a low performance and grade which wil also lead to so many carry overs. Students are idle and as the old saying goes "AN IDLE MAN IS THE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP". This will lead to an increase in crime and other illegal activities.
